# Chicago Crime Analysis

## Project Overview
This project, part of the DSC680-T302 Applied Data Science course, focuses on analyzing crime patterns in Chicago, with particular attention to the socioeconomic disparities between the north and south sides of the city. The analysis aims to provide insights for targeted interventions by policymakers and law enforcement to improve public safety and resource allocation.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Chicago Data Portal, which provides detailed information on reported crime incidents in the city from 2001 to the present.
